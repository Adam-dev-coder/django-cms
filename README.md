A django app for managing hierarchical pages of content in multiple languages, on different sites.

Django CMS handles the navigation rendering for you in multiple language with i18n slugs 
and the navigation can be extended by your own models.

Pages are rendered with a template that have placeholders that get filled with plugins.
